# First steps in the app

Before you can use Ambys effectively you need to configure some things. If you try to add a new daily note right off the bat nothing will really show up. That happens because there no note attributes are configured. Daily notes are built so that you can create your own attributes to track.

Head over to the settings and create attributes of what you want to track. Be considerate! You can change the name later but you cannot change the element as it may cause weird conversion issues.

Additionally you have to edit your note configuration. This will define the "template" of what will show up if you create a new daily note. You can always change this config. Old daily notes created with an old config will show up exactly as they were created. This config only manipulates newly created daily notes. If you have attributes that you dont want to track regularly you can temporarily add attributes when you click new daily note.
