# Welcome to Ambys

Ambys is a modern web application designed to help you track and manage your health data easily and efficiently.

## Disclaimer

This is my first ever open source project. I have built small web apps before but there were a lot of things for this project (responsive design, internationalization, ...) that i have never done before. Also I was the only user/tester during initial development so i expect there being quite a lot of room for improvements and possibly bugs. I am happy for any issues, bug reports, or suggestions for improvements.

## Key Features

- **Diary:** Create your own attributes and track them daily. View them in a list or calendar view.
- **Public and Private Notebooks:** Create notebooks shared across the instance or just for yourself.
- **Medication Plan:** Always keep track of what medication to take and keep a history of it.
- **Multiple Users:** Create multiple users for each user using the instance. Keep in mind that the database is not encrypted so data could be read across users.
- **Personal Access Tokens:** Integrate the API in your own services.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Supports both English and German at the moment.
- **Deployment with docker-compose:** Easily set up your own instance with a single docker-compose (and one .env) file.
- **PWA Ready:** Installable if your instance is protected with https. Other PWA featues like offline-use are not utilized yet.
